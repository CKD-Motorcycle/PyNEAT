# PyNEAT

Implementing "Evolving Neural Networks through Augmenting Topologies" by Kenneth O. Stanley and Risto Miikkulainen(2002) in Python3.5.

Basing this off @CodeReclaimers implementation of neat-society and Ugo Vierucci's implementation of JNEAT.

The propose is to learn as I go and to provide an easier version to play want to get in code than other available implementations. 
The goal is not quantity of features or performance, but rather a learning tool for me and others.
